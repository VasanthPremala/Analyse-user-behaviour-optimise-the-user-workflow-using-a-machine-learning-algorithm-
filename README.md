Firstly I have created an e-commerce website using wordpress . I have created e-commerce website named vasanthstores online clothing store. It contains various webpages such as home, store,men,women,accessories,account, about, contact us. And store contains about 100 products with different categories. There are various features like product details, add to cart, search products and payment gateway. We have also used filters to change the product list (e.g. category, price range, etc.). I have applied user guiding tool named WalkMe that will guide a new user through orderly steps on my website to use it in the most simple way to buy a product. I have integrated my website to analytics platform named Google Analytics. This tool is able to track the users action and the time spent by the users on the various actions of the website. I have accumulated the analytics data from various users and stored it. I have collected data of around 180 users with various datapoints such as time spent by users on the different pages on website, filters being used by the users , time spent by users on particular product page, etc. Then, Fitting the Markov Chain model gives us the transition probabilities matrices and the lambda parameters of the chain for each one of the three lags along with the Start and End Probabilities.
